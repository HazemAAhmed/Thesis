\begin_layout Chapter
RFID Anti-collision Protocols 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter presents the most common anti-collisions algorithms for passive
 RFID systems, either by using the PHY layer or the MAC layer.
 It will emphasize the anti-collision algorithms which are compatible with
 the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard, as it is the main focus of this thesis, because
 it is the most suitable standard for the dense passive RFID applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is organized as follows: Section 1 gives an overview about
 the PHY layer anti-collision algorithms.
 In section 2, different MAC-layer anti-collision algorithms are presented.
 Afterwards, a brief description for the EPCglobal C1 G2 reading process
 will be presented in section 3.
 Section 4 will give an introduction about the main PHY-layer parameters,
 e.g.
 the collision recovery and the slots duration in modern RFID readers.
 Then, it will show the effect of these parameters on the MAC-layer anti-collisi
on algorithm, which will be the main focus of the remaining part in this
 thesis.

\begin_layout Section
PHY-Layer Anti-collision Protocols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different PHY layer anti-collision protocols have been developed to separate
 colliding tag signals on the PHY layer.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the most common PHY layer anti-collision protocols, which are: FDMA,
 SDMA, CDMA and TDMA.
 These algorithms will be briefly discussed in the following paragraphs:

Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA):

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this protocol, the frequency band is divided into different sub-frequency
 bands and tags are distributed among them.
 However, this technique adds complexity to the system.
 Readers should be able to decode different frequencies at the same time.
 Moreover, tags should be able to select its desirable sub-channel, which
 is incompatible with EPCglobal C1 G2.
 Only active tags can do such function

Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA):
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This technique makes use of spreading tags over the reading area.
 It provides a high increase in the reading efficiency 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The main drawback is the cost of implementing the RFID reader with multiple
 antennas.
 Moreover, in dense applications, the distances between the tags are very
 small in order to be distributed on the reading area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA):
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This protocol uses spread-spectrum modulation techniques to transmit the
 data over the entire spectrum
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CDMA"

\end_inset

.
 CDMA is the ideal procedure for many applications, e.g.
 navigation systems.
 However, the cost of the tags will severely increase.
 Thereby, it is not an optimum protocol for dense RFID applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA):
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "TDMA"
description "Time Division Multiple Access"

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this protocol, a single frequency band is divided into time slots and
 assigned to the tags.
 In this technique, each tag must be synchronized to the time slots and
 sends its information at the beginning of the selected slot 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TDMA"

\end_inset

.
 This technique can be directly applied to passive RFID systems.
 In such systems, the simplicity of tags transfers the complexity to the
 readers, where the reader has to control the time synchronization.
 However, in active RFID systems, synchronization can be either centralized
 or distributed to the tags.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
MAC-Layer Anti-collision Protocols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PHY anti-collision proposals are not cost effective for the market challenges
 of the passive RFID technologies, because they require additional modifications
 of the tags.
 Therefore, tags collisions solutions are commonly implemented at the MAC-layer.
 This section will discuss the most common MAC-layer anti-collision protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure

 presents the main classification of the most common MAC-layer anti-collision
 protocols.
 MAC-layer anti-collision protocols are classified into two main categories:
 Deterministic protocols and probabilistic protocols.
 Deterministic or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Tree-based
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 protocols are used in systems with known number of tags to be identified
 in the reading area, because these protocols identify the depth of the
 tree by knowing the number of tags.
 Probabilistic or

\end_inset

ALOHA-based
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 protocols are used in systems with an unknown number of tags.

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections will discuss in details the most commonly used anti-colli
sion algorithms either deterministic or probabilistic based algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Deterministic Anti-collision Protocols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These protocols are commonly named tree-based anti-collision protocols.
 Using these algorithms, the reader aims to identify a set of tags in the
 coverage area in subsequent time slots 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tree1"

\end_inset

.
 Each time slot contains a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Query
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 command, transmitted from the reader, and the response of tags in the reading
 area.
 If there is more than a single tag reply in one slot, a collision occurs
 and the reader tries to split the tags into two subgroups.
 The reader repeats the splitting procedure until it receives a single tag
 reply.
 Tree-based anti-collision protocols can be classified into two groups:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Binary Tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The binary tree algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Binary_tree_new"

\end_inset

 is commonly used in tree-based anti-collision protocols.
 Using this algorithm, if a collision occurs in a time slot, each collided
 tag selects randomly '0' or '1'.
 Thus, the colliding tags will be separated into two subgroups.
 Tags, which selected '0', always transmit their IDs to the reader first.
 If a collision occurs again, collided tags are splitted again by selecting
 '0' or '1'.
 Tags, which have selected '1', have to wait until all other tags which
 have selected '0' are successfully identified by the reader.
 This procedure continues recursively until the subset is reduced to one
 tag, that is identified without collisions.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Binary-tree-anti-collision"

\end_inset

 shows an example of the binary tree algorithm resolving the collision of
 four tags in a reading area.
 Thus, there is a collided time slot at the beginning.
 At time slot 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, each collided tag has to choose '0' or '1' randomly.
 In the shown example, tags 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 have selected '0'.
 However, tags 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 have selected '1'.
 According to the binary tree algorithm, tags 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 have to wait until tags 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 are successfully identified.
 Therefore, time slot 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 is a collided slot due to the collision between tags 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

.
 Due to this collision, both tags 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 have to choose either '0' or '1'.
 In this example, both tags 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 have selected '1'.
 This resulted in an empty slot in time slot 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and a collided slot in time slot 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

.
 Afterwards, tag 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 has selected '0' and tag 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 has selected '1'.
 This random selection made them separated into two successive successful
 slots (
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

).
 At this moment, tags 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 started their identification process.
 The reader repeats the previous process until identifying all tags in the
 reading area.

Query Tree

\begin_layout Standard
Another tree algorithm category is the query tree algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Query_tree"

\end_inset

.
 It is also commonly used in tree-based anti-collision algorithms.
 Using this algorithm, the broadcast is a query signal asking the tags for
 a reply.
 If there is a collision, it starts splitting the collided tags into two
 groups by sending a new query signal with a single bit 0 or 1 randomly.
 Tags in the reading area receive this signal and match this bit with their
 ID.
 If this bit matches their ID, they transmit their ID.
 If a collision took place again, the reader adds another random bit 0 or
 1 to its next query signal.
 This process is repeated until the reader receives a successful single
 tag reply.

 presents an example for the query tree algorithm resolving the collision
 of 4 tags in a reading area.
 At time slot 1, the reader broadcasts a query signal asking them for a
 reply.
 A collision between the four tags is taking place.
 The reader sends a '0' in a new query signal at time slot 2.
 However, there are three tags sharing this bit, so a new collision between
 the three tags is happening.
 Thereby, the reader has sent a '00' in its next query signal in time slot
 3.
 At this time, there is a collision between two tags, leading the reader
 to send '000' in time slot 4.
 At last, the reader has received a single successful reply from tag 1.
 This process is repeated until the reader identify all the tags in the
 reading area.

\begin_layout Subsection
Probabilistic Anti-collision Protocols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main disadvantage of using tree-based protocols is that these protocols
 are not efficient in dense networks (large number of tags), due to the
 increase in identification time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Aloha1"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in dense networks, ALOHA-based anti-collision protocols are
 more suitable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Aloha1"

\end_inset

.
 ALOHA anti-collision protocols are therefore the most commonly used in
 UHF active and passive RFID.
 ALOHA anti-collision protocols can be classified into the following four
 groups: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Basic ALOHA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first group is widely known as basic ALOHA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pure_ALOHA"

\end_inset

 anti-collision protocol.
 Basic ALOHA is the simplest anti-collision protocol for passive read-only-memor
y RFID tags.
 This protocol works as follows: The reader sends a query signal to power
 the tags.
 Then, tags send their ID randomly in time.
 The reader can only recognize the single tag reply case, without any ability
 to handle the collision.
 When every tag replies to the reader without checking whether the channel
 is free or not there is always the possibility of the collision.
 In case of collision, the collided tags wait for a random duration of time
 and transmit again till it transmits successfully.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pure_ALOHA"

\end_inset

, the maximum available reading efficiency is 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[18.4]{\%}$
\end_inset

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Example-for-pure"

\end_inset

 shows an example of basic ALOHA for a single reader identifying four tags.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Slotted ALOHA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second ALOHA anti-collision protocol is the slotted ALOHA (SA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "SA"
description "Slotted ALOHA"

\end_inset

 protocol 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Slotted_ALOHA"

\end_inset

.
 As shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Example-for-slotted"

\end_inset

, slotted ALOHA is based on basic ALOHA.
 However, the time is divided into slots.
 In this protocol, the reader broadcasts a query signal which includes the
 beginning of each slot.
 Each tag chooses randomly if it will transmit in this slot or wait for
 a coming slot.
 Each tag is allowed only to start transmission at the beginning of each
 time slot.
 Therefore, the maximum possible collided time is a single complete slot.
 However, in the basic ALOHA protocol, the possible collided time is two
 slots.
 Thus, the maximum available reading efficiency using slotted ALOHA is 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[36.8]{\%}$

Framed Slotted ALOHA (FSA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third group is Framed Slotted ALOHA (FSA)

symbol "FSA"
description "Framed Slotted ALOHA"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Aloha1"

\end_inset

.
 The FSA anti-collision protocol uses a fixed frame length.
 Thus, the frame length is fixed during the complete tag identification
 process.
 At the beginning of each frame, the reader broadcasts a query signal to
 all  tags.
 This signal includes the frame size.
 Each tag has to choose a random number between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L-1$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the frame length.
 If a collision happens, the colliding tags have to retry in the next frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Example-for-frame"

\end_inset

 presents an example for the identification process of four tags using FSA.
 In this example, the frame length is selected to four slots.
 According to figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Example-for-frame"

\end_inset

, tag 4 transmits in the first slot alone.
 Thus, it is a successful slot.
 In the second slot, no tag has replied.
 So, it is an empty slot.
 In the third slot, tags 2 and 3 have replied together, which results in
 a collided slot.
 According to the FSA rules, tags 3 and 4 are not allowed to resubmit their
 IDs again during the same frame.
 Thus in slot 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

, only tag 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 is allowed to reply to have another successful slot.
 In the next frame, the same procedure is repeated until all tags are identified.

 According to the previously published RFID work, DFSA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is the most widely used anti-collision protocol for RFID systems owing
 to its simplicity and robustness.
 In DFSA, the reading process is divided into successive frames, in which
 each frame includes a specific number of slots.
 During the reading process, each active tag randomly assigns itself to
 one of the available slots in the frame.

 Therefore, each slot can take one of the following three variable states:
 1) Successful Slot: One tag only chooses this slot, is fully identified,
 and then is deactivated by the reader within the successive frames.
 2) Collided Slot: Multiple tags reply, resulting in a collision.
 The collided tags normally remain in their active state and retry their
 transmission in the next frame.
 3) Empty Slot: No tag responds and the slot remains unused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increasing the reading speed can directly be translated into the maximization
 of the number of successful slots in reference to the number of idle or
 collided slots.
 Based on the random access theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, for a given number of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 tags, the expected number of empty

\end_inset

 and collided 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 slots in each frame with a length of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 slots can be expressed by the following equations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

The conventional definition of the expected reading efficiency

 is given by the ratio between the expected number of successful slots

 Based on (

 Furthermore, the number of tags may even vary, e\SpecialChar \@.

 Therefore, such applications employ DFSA

 First, DFSA has to estimate the number of tags in the interrogation area,
 then it calculates the optimal frame size

 for the next reading frame.

 As shown in the chart, the reader starts with an initial frame length.
 Then, it broadcasts this frame length to the tags in the reading area.
 Afterwards, it performs a normal FSA.

 If yes, the reader estimates the remaining number of tags in the reading

 If not, the reading cycle will be terminated.

 will be given.
 The reading process consists of multiple inventory rounds.
 Each inventory round typically has a different frame length.
 Figure

\end_inset

 shows an example for the frame length adaptation in EPCglobal C1 G2.
 According to figure

\end_inset

, the initial frame length is 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{Q_{ini}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{ini}=4$
\end_inset

.
 Then each slot is checked.
 If there is no tag reply, the frame length should be decreased.
 If it is a collided slot, the frame length is increased.
 Finally, if the slot is a successful slot, the frame length will remain
 as it is.

Cross Layer Anti-Collision Protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, RFID receivers have been developed, that are able to convert part
 of the collided slots into successful slots.
 Moreover, new RFID readers can even identify the type of the slots and
 terminate the empty and collided slots earlier.
 In this section, a brief discussion about these two parameters will be
 presented.
 Afterwards, a motivation to reconfigure the MAC layer to make use of the
 PHY-layer parameters is presented.

\begin_layout Subsection
Collision Recovery in UHF RFID
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collision recovery in RFID systems is the capability of the reader to convert
 part of the collided slots into successful slots.
 According to EPCglobal C1 G2, the reader can only acknowledge one single
 tag per slot.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2013_capture"

\end_inset

, the collision recovery capability of the RFID system depends on different
 factors: First, the capabilities of the receiver, e.g.
 number of antennas.
 Second, the distance between the collided tags.
 Finally, the type of the channel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, some research groups (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Capture_2011"

\end_inset

) have concentrated on collision recovery using the spatial diversity of
 the received signal.
 They have proposed the following reading efficiency equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta=P(1)+\alpha\cdot\sum_{i=2}^{n}P(i),\label{eq:eff_PHY_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=2}^{n}P(i)$
\end_inset

 is the probability of collision, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the average collision resolving probability.
 In this efficiency equation, the RFID reader can convert the collided slots
 into successful slots with a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 The authors have assumed unlimited and equal collision resolving probability
 coefficients.
 For example, the probability to resolve two collided tags is identical
 to the probability to resolve ten collided tags, which is an unpractical
 assumption, because the more collided tags per slot, the lower collision
 recovery capability.
 Another research groups 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2012_journal_CR,PHY111,PHY112,PHY113"

\end_inset

 considered the limited capability of a RFID reader to resolve collisions.
 They have proposed a limited reading efficiency expressed as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta=\sum_{i=1}^{M}P(i),\label{eq:rff_PHY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P(i)=\binom{n}{i}\left(\frac{1}{L}\right)^{i}\left(1-\frac{1}{L}\right)^{n-i}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 represents the number of collided tags that the reader is capable to recover.
 The authors assumed that the probability to recover one tag from 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 collided tags equals to 
\begin_inset Formula $100\%$
\end_inset

, independently of the actual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eff_PHY_2"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:rff_PHY"

\end_inset

), the reading efficiency strongly depends on the capability of the PHY
 layer to resolve the collision.
 Thus, in this thesis, the effect of the collision recovery capability on
 the MAC layer optimization will be addressed in more details.

 Hence, the durations of the different slot types are not identical, which

According to the above discussion, the reading efficiency equation will
 be affected by the different slots durations.
 In this thesis, the different slot duration lengths will be addressed in
 more details in the MAC layer optimization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summarizing, the main lack in the previous RFID research is that the MAC
 layer is optimized independently on the PHY layer.
 However, the PHY-layer properties affect the optimization parameters of
 the MAC layer, e.g.
 the number of tags estimation and the optimum frame length.
 This thesis concentrates on optimizing the DFSA anti-collision protocol.
 In the proposed algorithm, the PHY layer parameters will be considered,
 which are the collision recovery capability of the RFID reader and the
 differences in slot durations.
