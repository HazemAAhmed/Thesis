Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a rapidly emerging technology that
 wirelessly transmits the identity of transponders (tags) attached to an
 object or a person.
 The RFID technology took more attention since the adoption of the EPCglobal
 Class 1 Gen 2 standard in 2005.
 It has replaced other automatic identification systems like barcodes in
 some applications, e.g.
 logistics.
 In such applications, the identification time is very critical performance
 parameter.
 Currently, developments are underway in various areas of RFID to decrease
 the total identification time for a bunch of tags.
 The present thesis focused on passive Ultra High Frequency (UHF) RFID,
 whose transmission on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is scheduled
 by Framed Slotted Aloha (FSA).
 Conventional FSA regards only the reply of a single tag as a successful
 slot.
 Empty and collided slots are considered as losses.
 Therefore, the reading efficiency is limited due to empty and collided
 slots.
 Modern physical layer systems have the capability of converting part of
 the collided slots into successful slots.
 This is called Collision Recovery.
 Moreover, modern RFID readers can identify the type of slot, e.g., successful,
 collided, or empty.
 In addition, the readers are able to terminate a slot earlier upon recognizing
 that it is empty.
 The performance of such systems depends strongly on two main parameters:
 First, the precise estimation of the number of tags in the reading area.
 Second, the optimization of the FSA frame length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, a novel tag estimation method is introduced, taking into
 consideration the collision recovery capability of modern RFID systems.
 The proposed method provides the advantage of giving a novel closed form
 solution for the tag population estimator, which considers the collision
 recovery probability of the used system.
 Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is more accurate
 when compared to state-of-the-art.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from that, closed form solutions for the optimum FSA frame length
 for different scenarios are calculated.
 First, Time-Aware Framed Slotted ALOHA proposal.
 This proposal considers the differences in slots durations without collision
 recovery capability.
 The second scenario is the Time-Aware and constant collision recovery coefficie
nts system.
 This proposal provides a novel closed form equation for the frame length
 considering the different slot durations and the collision recovery capability
 with equal coefficients.
 Moreover, a new calculation method of the collision recovery probability
 per frame is presented.
 In the third scenario, the multiple collision recovery coefficients system
 is introduced.
 There, the differences in the collision recovery probability coefficients
 are examined with equal slots durations.
 In this regard, the values of the collision recovery coefficients are extracted
 from the physical layer parameters.
 Finally, a Time-aware and Multiple collision recovery system is suggested,
 taking into account the multiple collision recovery probability coefficients
 in addition to the different slot durations.
 For each scenario, timing comparisons are presented in the latter simulation
 results show the reading time reduction using the proposed frame length
 compared to other the state-of-the-art algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis focuses on the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard.
 Therefore, the tags cannot be modified, and all the improvements are done
 only on the reader side.
 However, due to the limitation of the EPCglobal C1 G2, there is still a
 room of improvement between the proposed solutions and the theoretical
 lower bound of the identification time.
 Therefore, compatible improvements of the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard are
 proposed.
 This proposal includes compatible modifications in the UHF RFID tags/readers,
 to be capable of acknowledging more than a sole tag per slot.
 Finally, the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed system optimization
s lead to identify tags in significantly shorter time, which is crucial
 for time-sensitive applications.
