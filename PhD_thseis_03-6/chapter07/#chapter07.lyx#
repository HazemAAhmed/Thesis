\begin_layout Chapter
Conclusions and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays, there is a great interest in RFID due to the number of applications
 used in this field.
 RFID systems provide low cost and low power object identification and tracking
 mechanisms.
 It is the key requirement for different ultra dense applications, e.g., logistics
, access management and timing sports events.
 In such applications, dense number of tags are expected and fast identification
 is required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of the thesis is to increase the system throughput and to
 faster identify tags in the reader range.
 The transmission of tags is scheduled on the MAC layer with a anti-collision
 protocol called DFSA.
 The identification time directly depends on reading efficiency of the DFSA
 anti-collision protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DFSA reading efficiency is controlled by two main parameters: 1) The
 accuracy of number of tags estimation algorithm.
 2) Frame length optimization.
 Modern RFID receivers have been developed from the PHY layer.
 They have a collision recovery capability, which means that some of collided
 slots can be converted to a successful slots.
 This capability reduces the losses from the collided slots.
 Moreover, modern RFID receivers have the capability to identify the type
 of slot and terminate it as soon as it recognizes that, it is not a successful
 slot.
 This capability reduces the losses from the empty slots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, I focus on optimizing the DFSA anti-collision algorithm
 taking into consideration the physical layer parameters e.g.
 the collision recovery capability and the differences in slots durations.
 Thus, the thesis aims to establish and propose of advanced algorithms to
 increase the performance of the system.
 Since my work is focused on passive UHF RFID systems that work with simple
 tags which are only capable of in-complex operations, almost all proposed
 changes and signal processing is performed on the reader side except in
 chapter 6, a new compatible changes of EPCglobal C1 G2 standards are proposed.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advanced RFID readers, which are proposed in this thesis shorten the
 mean average reading time.
 They incorporate different PHY layer parameters in order to efficiently
 optimize the MAC anti-collision protocols.
 First, in chapter 4 a novel closed form solution for a collision recovery
 aware ML estimator that considers the effects of the collision recovery
 probability of the RFID reader.
 The theoretical derivations lead to a new analytical estimator that can
 be easily implemented in RFID readers.
 Using the proposed formula, we need neither look-up tables nor numerical
 searching.
 Furthermore, the estimator gives more precise relative number of tags estimatio
n error compared to the other state-of-art proposals.
 Moreover, the proposed estimation algorithm reduces the total identification
 time by almost 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[10]{\%}$
\end_inset

 compared to the best other state-of-art solution.
 In chapter 5, different proposals of frame length optimization is presented.
 The first proposal is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Time aware frame length
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this proposal, only the differences in slots durations is considered
 and no collision recovery effect is considered.
 A closed form solution for the optimum frame length is proposed.

----------------------------------------------
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They merged the collision recovery coefficients and the differences in slot
 durations.
 Thus, in order to benefit from the collision recovery expertise, changes
 in the number of tags estimations should be applied.
 Besides, the higher collision recovery capability of the system, the shorter
 optimum frame length is recommended.
 According to the differences in slot duration results, the smaller the
 duration of the empty slot compared to that of the collided slot, the longer
 optimum FSA frame length is required.
 Additionally, the evaluation of the complete read out process is performed
 and the obtained results prove that the proposed advanced RFID readers
 significantly decrease the identification time.
 Due to the simple tags implementation in EPCglobal C1 G2, improvements
 in the standards would be recommended to approach the theoretical limit
 of the reading time.

\begin_layout Section
Open Issues and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the effort invested in this dissertation, there are still some remaining
 issues left that require further investigations.
 To mention but some examples, the influence of the initial frame length
 of the proposed system is neglected.
 The influence of the initial frame length should be analyzed.
 In addition, the MAC layer knowledge of the current SNR should send a feedback
 signal to the PHY layer.
 In this signal, the MAC layer decide to start resolving the current collided
 slot either to a successful or unsuccessful slot, depending on the current
 value of the SNR.
 Thereby, if the current SNR value is below a certain threshold, it might
 be better to leave this slot to a normal collided slot.
 On the other hand, when the current value of the SNR is above this threshold,
 it would be better to resolve this collided slot to a successful slot.
 Finally, practical assessment of the proposed work through measurements
 would be beneficial for a more comprehensive evaluation.xx
