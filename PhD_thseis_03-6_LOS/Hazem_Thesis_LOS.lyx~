Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a rapid emerging technology that
 wirelessly transmits the identity of a tag attached to an object or a person.
 It usually operates in a dense tag environment.
 The present work focused on passive Ultra High Frequency (UHF) tags whose
 transmission on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer is scheduled by Framed
 Slotted Aloha (FSA).
 Conventional FSA regards only the reply of a single tag as a successful
 slot.
 Empty and collided slots are considered as losses.
 Thereby all the replied tags are discarded.
 Therefore, the reading efficiency is limited due to the effect of empty
 and collided slots.
 Modern physical layer systems have the capability of converting part of
 the collided slots into successful slots.
 This is called Collision Recovery.
 Moreover, modern RFID readers can identify the type of slot (successful,
 collided, or empty).
 In addition, the readers are able to terminate the slot earlier upon recognizin
g that there is no tag reply.
 The performance of such systems strongly depends on two main parameters:
 First, the precise estimation of the number of tags in the reading area.
 Second, the optimization of the FSA frame length.
 In this thesis, a novel tag estimation method is introduced, taking into
 consideration the collision recovery capability of the system.
 The main advantage of the proposed method is giving a novel closed form
 solution for the tag population estimator which considers the collision
 recovery probability of the used system.
 Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution is more accurate
 when compared to the literature.
 Timing comparisons presented in the simulation results show the reduced
 identification delay of the proposed estimation method compared to other
 proposals.

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from that, a closed form solution for the optimum FSA frame length
 is calculated in different scenarios.
 The first one is the Time-Aware Framed Slotted ALOHA proposal.
 In such proposal, the differences in slots durations is only considered
 with no collision recovery capability.
 Simulations indicate that the proposed solution gives the most accurate
 results with respect to the exact solution.
 The second scenario is the Time-Aware and constant collision recovery coefficie
nts system.
 This suggetsed solution provides a novel closed form equation for the frame
 length considering the different slot durations and the collision recovery
 capability assuming equal coefficients.
 Moreover, a new calculation method of the collision recovery probability
 per frame is presented.
 Simulations indicate that the proposed solution gives exact results for
 all relevant parameter configurations without any need for multi-dimensional
 look-up tables.
 In the third scenario, multiple collision recovery coefficients system
 is introduced.
 In this proposal, the differences in the collision recovery probability
 coefficients are examined with equal slots durations.
 In this regard, the values of the collision recovery coefficients are extracted
 from the physical layer parameters.
 Simulation results display the mean reduction in reading time using the
 proposed frame length compared to the other proposals.
 Finally, Time-aware and Multiple collision recovery system is suggested,
 taking into account the multiple collision recovery probability coefficients
 in addition to the different slot durations.
 Timing comparisons are presented in the latter simulation results show
 the reading time reduction using the proposed frame length compared to
 other the state-of-the-art algorithms.

This thesis focuses on the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard.
 Therefore, the tags could not be touched, and all the improvements are
 done only in the reader side.
 However, due to the limitation of the EPCglobal C1 G2, there is still a
 room of improvement between the proposed solutions and the theoretical
 lower bound of the identification time.
 Therefore, a compatible improvements of the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard are
 proposed.
 This system includes compatible modifications in the UHF RFID tags/Readers,
 to be capable of acknowledging more than a sole tag per slot.
 Finally, the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed frame length
 optimizations leads to identify tags in significantly shorter time which
 is of a great importance for time-sensitive applications
