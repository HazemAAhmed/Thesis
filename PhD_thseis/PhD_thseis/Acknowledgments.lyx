The completion of this thesis would not have been possible without Prof.
 Dr.- Ing Albert Heubergerâ€™s support and patience, as he guided me throughout
 my doctoral studies with his unwavering enthusiasm, for which I am extremely
 grateful.
 Many thanks go to Dr.-Ing Joerg Robert for his support, guidance and for
 answering my never ending questions with pleasure.
 Moreover, I want to acknowledge the support of my colleagues in our research
 group at the University of Erlangen.
 It was a great pleasure working with you all.
 Thank you for your support.
 Special thanks go to my colleague Hamed Kenawy for the constructive cooperation
 during the entire thesis work.
 Last but not least, I would like to thank my family especially my parents;
 Sawsan Megahed and Abdelaal Ibrahim.
 They have shown unequivocal support from the very beginning and throughout
 the process of completing this thesis as well as my sweethearts; Shaimaa
 and Salma.
 No matter what I say would never suffice to express my gratitude towards
 you.
 Thank you for your understanding, caring and for your presence in my life.
