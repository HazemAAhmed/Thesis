\begin_layout Chapter
Frame Length Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In FSA, there are two main factors controlling the reading efficiency, and
 hence the reading time in RFID systems.
 These two factors are precision of the number of tags estimation, which
 was discussed in chapter 4, and the optimal FSA frame length calculation,
 which is discussed in this chapter.
 Previous studies have focused on the frame length calculations using the
 conventional Dynamic Framed Slotted ALOHA algorithms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Aloha4_Vogt"

\end_inset

.
 In such systems, only the single tag reply is considered as a successful
 slot, and if multiple tags respond simultaneously, a collision occurs.
 Then all tags' replies in collided slots are discarded.
 In such systems, the optimum frame length is equal to the number of tags
 in the reading area 
\begin_inset Formula $L=n$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2010_Vogt_problem"

\end_inset

.
 However, as mentioned before, modern system can recover collisions and
 convert a part of the collided slots into successful ones 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2009_capture"

\end_inset

.
 In such systems, it is more beneficial to increase the number of collided
 slots compared to the number of empty slots by decreasing the optimum frame
 length.
 This is because these systems gain more from the collided slots compared
 to the empty slots by converting the collided slots to successful slots.
 In addition, most of the previous studies assumed constant slot durations
 regardless the type of the slot 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Aloha4_Vogt,2010_Vogt_problem,Vogt_1,DFSA_shoute_Random"

\end_inset

.
 However, the durations of the slots in RFID systems depend on the slot
 type, i.e., empty, successful, or collided.
 In such systems, the empty slot duration is shorter than the collided slot
 durations and shorter than the successful slot duration.
 Therefore, in such systems, it is better to increase the frame length,
 because the losses from the empty slots is less than the losses from the
 collided ones.
 To solve the above contradiction, this chapter discusses the optimum DFSA
 frame length taking into consideration the collision recovery capability
 and the different slot durations.
 These optimizations are discussed in different scenarios depending on the
 RFID system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is organized as follows.
 Section 1 discusses the effect of the different slot durations, where a
 new closed form solution for the optimum frame length is proposed.
 In section 2, the effect of the collision recovery probability with constant
 coefficients in addition to the time differences in slot durations is considere
d.
 Then, a new closed form solution for the optimum frame length, which maximizes
 the system performance, is presented.
 Section 3 illustrates the influence of using multiple collision recovery
 coefficients assuming constant slot durations, thus eliciting a new reading
 efficiency called multiple collision recovery coefficients reading efficiency.
 Then, a novel closed form solution for the optimum frame length is also
 derived for this system.
 Section 4 shows a new closed form solution for the optimum frame length
 for a system; taking into consideration the time difference in slot durations,
 in addition to the multiple collision recovery coefficients.
 Finally, section 5 presents performance comparisons between the proposed
 frame lengths and the existing state-of-the-art FSA algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Time Aware System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, some research groups have focused on optimizing the frame length
 in case of non-equal slot durations.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "4_2_numerical_time_Lopt,Ref_4_4_2013_Cap_time"

\end_inset

, the authors proposed a numerical solution for the optimal frame length.
 This method depends on searching for the optimal frame length, which maximizes
 the reading efficiency.
 Moreover, it also depends on the tag-to-reader data rate, which makes the
 searching process more complicated.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ICC_2006"

\end_inset

, the mean number of resolved tags in unit time is optimized.
 This is done by considering the different slot durations.
 However, this approach is based on a complex multidimensional table look-up,
 which may be time consuming.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "optimizin_total_latency"

\end_inset

 suggested to search for the optimum frame length that minimizes the mean
 time needed to resolve a number of tags.
 However, the authors reached a recursive Bellman-equation, which is difficult
 to be applied in systems with real-time restrictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we propose a novel closed form solution for the optimum
 frame length in FSA for RFID systems.
 The proposed solution gives a direct and linear relation between the frame
 length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, and the number of tags 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in the reading area.
 Furthermore, it includes a factor representing the different slot durations.

\begin_layout Subsection
Closed Form Solution for Time Aware System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For calculating the proposed optimal time-aware frame size 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{_{TA}}$
\end_inset

, which considers the different slot durations, it is important to define
 the time-aware reading efficiency 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{_{TA}}$
\end_inset

.
 The time-aware reading efficiency is defined as the ratio between the total
 successful time and the total frame time to be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{_{TA}}=\frac{t_{s}\cdot S}{t_{e}\cdot E+t_{s}\cdot S+t_{c}\cdot C}\,,\label{eq:eff-semi_simple}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s}\cdot S$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{e}\cdot E,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}\cdot E$
\end_inset

 are respectively the expected total successful, idle, and collided times.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 are the expected numbers of successful, empty and collided slots.
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{e}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}$
\end_inset

 are respectively the successful, idle, and collided slot durations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to derive the new optimum frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{TA}$
\end_inset

 under the time-aware environment.
 According to EPCglobal C1 G2, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is always integer.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{TA}$
\end_inset

 can be optimized by finding the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 which maximizes the time-aware reading efficiency.
 This is achieved by differentiating the reading efficiency in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eff-semi_simple"

\end_inset

) with respect to the frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and equating the result to zero, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 can only have integer values
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\eta_{TA}}{\partial L}=0.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
According to (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: number of slot definition"

\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 are function of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 Taking into consideration that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{e}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}$
\end_inset

 are constants for a given system specification, the equation is
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{(t_{e}E+t_{s}S+t_{c}C)t_{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial L}(S)-t_{s}S\frac{\partial}{\partial L}(t_{e}E+t_{s}S+t_{c}C)}{(t_{e}E+t_{s}S+t_{c}C)^{2}} & = & 0.
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\size default
After multiplying both sides by the denominator and dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s}$
\end_inset

 (non-zero constant), the equation can be simplified to be
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
(t_{e}E+t_{c}C)\frac{\partial}{\partial L}(S)+t_{s}S\frac{\partial}{\partial L}(S)=S\frac{\partial}{\partial L}(t_{e}E+t_{c}C)+t_{s}S\frac{\partial}{\partial L}S.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
After subtracting the term which is multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s},$
\end_inset

 the equation finally becomes
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\{ t_{e}E+t_{c}C\right\} \frac{\partial}{\partial L}(S)=S\frac{\partial}{\partial L}\left\{ t_{e}E+t_{c}C\right\} .\label{eq:simple differentiation-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
Then, substituting by the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: number of slot definition"

\end_inset

) leads to
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\{ t_{e}\underset{E}{\underbrace{L\left(1-\frac{1}{L}\right)^{n}}}+t_{c}\underset{C}{\underbrace{(L-\left(1-\frac{1}{L}\right)^{n-1}(L-n-1))}}\right\} \nonumber \\
\times\frac{\partial}{\partial L}\underset{S}{\underbrace{n\left(1-\frac{1}{L}\right)^{n-1}}}\nonumber \\
=\underset{S}{\underbrace{n\left(1-\frac{1}{L}\right)^{n-1}}}\label{eq:complex differentiation-1}\\
\times\frac{\partial}{\partial L}\left\{ t_{e}\underset{E}{\underbrace{L\left(1-\frac{1}{L}\right)^{n}}}+t_{c}\underset{C}{\underbrace{(L-\left(1-\frac{1}{L}\right)^{n-1}(L-n-1))}}\right\} .\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

By simplifying the result, the final exact equation for the proposed time-aware
 frame length is given by the following implicit equation

\begin_inset Formula $L_{TA}$
\end_inset

 and the number of tags 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Lopt comlex expresion-1"

\end_inset

) is an implicit equation.
 Thus, an approximation is used to convert it to explicit equation.
 The equation can be expressed as
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)=\left(1-C_{_{t}}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta n}\right)^{n},\label{eq:bita equation-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{L_{TA}}{n}$
\end_inset

.
 As we are focusing on systems with many tags, the following approximation
 can be used
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta n}\right)^{n}=e^{-\frac{1}{\beta}},\label{eq:approx_1-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
which simplifies (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Lopt comlex expresion-1"

\end_inset

) to be
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta}\right)=\left(1-C_{_{t}}\right)e^{-\frac{1}{\beta}}\label{eq:first_approx-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
The analysis of (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Lopt comlex expresion-1"

\end_inset

) indicates that the relevant values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{L_{TA}}{n}$
\end_inset

 are in the region close to 1.
 Hence, a Taylor series for 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-\frac{1}{\beta}}$
\end_inset

 around one is developed which leads to be
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e^{-\frac{1}{\beta}}\simeq1-\frac{1}{\beta}+\frac{1}{2\beta^{2}}\label{eq:taylor-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
According to figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Second-order-Taylor"

\end_inset

, this approximation is very accurate in the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{n}{L}\leq1$
\end_inset

.
 After substituting by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta^{2}C_{_{t}}-\beta C_{_{t}}+0.5(C_{_{t}}-1)=0\label{eq:quadratic equation-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
By solving (

\begin_layout Subsection
Mean Reading Time Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conventional FSA systems, the slot durations are considered as constant
 slots.
 Thus, the total identification time is calculated by counting the average
 total number of slots needed to identify the complete number of tags in
 the reading area.
 Then, according to literature, the mean reduction in number of slots is
 calculated according to the following equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\unit[\zeta]{\%}=\left(\frac{\mbox{Slots_{conv.}}-\mbox{Slots_{proposed}}}{\mbox{Slots_{conv.}}}\right)\times100
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In time aware systems, the slot durations are variable.
 Therefore, the total identification time can only be calculated as time
 in seconds.
 Afterwards, the percentage of mean reading time reduction is calculated
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\unit[\zeta_{t}]{\%}=\left(\frac{\mbox{T{}_{conv.}}-\mbox{T{}_{proposed}}}{\mbox{\mbox{T{}_{conv.}}}}\right)\times100
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Saving-time-versus"

\end_inset

 shows simulation results for the reading time reduction of the proposed
 optimal time-aware frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{TA}$
\end_inset

 with reference to the classical optimal frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L=n$
\end_inset

 as a function of the slot durations constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 These simulations assume a perfect knowledge of the number of tags 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 According to the figure, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 means that the idle slot durations time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{e}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the optimum frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is theoretically infinite.
 According to the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "standard"

\end_inset

, the frame length takes only quantized values (power of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

).
 According to figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Quantized-Frame-Length_time"

\end_inset

, the number of tags in the reading area 
\begin_inset Formula $n=100$
\end_inset

 tags.
 Thus, the quantized optimum frame length is 
\begin_inset Formula $L=1024$
\end_inset

 slots.
 In this case, the proposed time-aware frame length can reduce the average
 reading time up to 
\begin_inset Formula $12\%$
\end_inset

 compared to the conventional optimization criterion.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}=1$
\end_inset

, the slot durations have identical length i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{e}=t_{c}$
\end_inset

, as in the conventional FSA, therefore, the reading efficiency in this
 case is obtained when 
\begin_inset Formula $L=n$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$

 whereas the other calculates the optimal frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{opt}$
\end_inset

 based on 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

 for maximizing the reading efficiency.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 illustrates the mean reduction of the reading time using the proposed time-awar
e frame length for the proposed ML number of tags estimation and the most
 well-known tag estimation algorithms using the value of the slot durations
 constant 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}=0.2$
\end_inset

.
 The main purpose of these simulations is to show the practical effect on
 the reading time by working with the proposed frame length using different
 tag estimation algorithms.
 Each curve presents the mean reduction of the reading time between the
 proposed frame length and the conventional frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L=n$
\end_inset

 using the same estimation algorithm.

\begin_inset Formula $13\,\%$

 In case of more accurate estimation algorithm such as Vogt

 and the proposed ML in chapter 4, the mean reduction of reading time is
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $9\,\%$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[12]{\%}$
\end_inset

.
 According to figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Percentage-of-Time"

\end_inset

, the better the estimation algorithms, the less reading time reduction,
 because it decreases the number of iterations in FSA process.
 However, using a non-accurate number of tags estimation algorithms, FSA
 needs more iterations, with more FSA frame length adaptations.
 That gives more importance for the proposed formula compared to the classical
 frame length adaptations.

Time and Collision Recovery System

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in chapter 4, modern RFID readers can convert a part of collided
 slots into successful slots, which is called the collision recovery capability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 According to the state-of-the-art 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "4_1_closed_form_Lopt_not_accurate,optimizin_total_latency,Capture_2011"

\end_inset

, the previous research is divided into three diverse groups.
 The first group considered only the average collision recovery probability
 for the frame length optimizations, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Capture_2011"

\end_inset

.
 The authors propose a closed form equation for the optimum frame length
 maximizing the reading throughput per frame.
 The second group observes only the different slot durations, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "4_1_closed_form_Lopt_not_accurate,optimizin_total_latency"

\end_inset

 as shown in the first proposal in the previous section.
 However, no closed form solution for the optimum frame length is derived.
 They calculate the optimum frame length numerically.
 The third group contemplates the different slot durations and the collision
 recovery probability, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Capture_time_2015,Ref_4_4_2013_Cap_time,2012_curve_fitting"

 Both

LatexCommand cite
key "Capture_time_2015,Ref_4_4_2013_Cap_time"

\end_inset

 give numerical solutions for the optimum frame length versus the collision
 recovery probability and the number of tags.
 The main problems of their numerical solutions are the multiple degrees
 of freedom.
 The solutions require a complex multidimensional look-up table, which has
 to consider all possible degrees of freedom.
 The authors in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2012_curve_fitting"

\end_inset

 use curve fitting to find a closed form solution for the optimum frame
 length at a specific collision recovery probability and timing.
 However, this solution cannot be generalized for all values of slot's timing
 and collision recovery probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, a closed form solution for the optimum frame length is
 derived by optimizing the reading throughput per frame, which does not
 require any look-up table 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 In addition, the average collision recovery probability and the different
 slot durations are considered.
 Moreover, the calculation method of the collision recovery probability
 based on the PHY layer is clarified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Closed Form Solution for Time and Collision Recovery System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this subsection, the proposed optimal time and collision recovery aware
 frame size 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{_{TCA}}$
\end_inset

is derived, which considers the different slot durations and the collision
 recovery probability.
 Thus, a new reading efficiency called Time and Collision Recovery Aware
 reading efficiency 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{_{TCA}}$
\end_inset

 is introduced.
 The main properties of this efficiency are the consideration of the different
 slot durations and the average collision recovery probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this efficiency, we added the average collision recovery probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 to the time aware efficiency in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eff-semi_simple"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, the time and collision recovery probability aware efficiency
 can then be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{_{_{TCA}}}=\frac{t_{s}\cdot S_{c}}{t_{e}\cdot E_{c}+t_{s}\cdot S_{c}+t_{c}\cdot C_{c}}.\label{eq:eff-TAC}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{c}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{c}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{c}$
\end_inset

 are respectively the expected number of empty, successful, an collided
 slots after adding the effect of the collision recovery probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 Their relation is given by
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{c}=E,\,S_{c}=S+\alpha\cdot C,\,C_{c}=(1-\alpha)\cdot C.\label{eq:Succ and Coll with cap}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
The target is to find the optimum frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{TCA}$
\end_inset

 which maximizes the proposed reading efficiency in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eff-TAC"

\end_inset

).
 This is again achieved by differentiating the reading efficiency 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{_{_{TCA}}}$
\end_inset

 of (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eff-TAC"

\end_inset

) with respect to the frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and equate the result to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is an integer value.
 Therefore, differentiating the equation is not fully correct.
 However, the resulting error is negligible as it is shown later.
 According to (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Succ and Coll with cap"

\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{c}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{c}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{c}$
\end_inset

 are functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{e}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{c}$
\end_inset

 are constants for a given system configuration.
 Thus, the equation can be simplified to be
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{(t_{e}E_{c}+t_{s}S_{c}+t_{c}C_{c})t_{s}\frac{d}{dL}(S_{c})-t_{s}S_{c}\frac{d}{dL}(t_{e}E_{c}+t_{s}S_{c}+t_{c}C_{c})}{(t_{e}E_{c}+t_{s}S_{c}+t_{c}C_{c})^{2}}=0
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\size default
After multiplying both sides by the denominator and dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s}$
\end_inset

 (non-zero constant), and subtracting the term, which is multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{s},$
\end_inset

 the equation results in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(t_{e}E_{c}+t_{c}C_{c}\right)\frac{d}{dL}(S_{c})=S_{c}\frac{d}{dL}\left(t_{e}E_{c}+t_{c}C_{c}\right).\label{eq:simple differentiation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\size default
Then, the substitution by the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{c}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{c}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{c}$
\end_inset

 from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) leads to the final exact equation for the proposed time and collision
 recovery probability aware frame length
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\frac{n}{L_{_{TCA}}})+\alpha\cdot C_{t}\cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{L_{_{TCA}}}\right)\label{eq:Lopt comlex expresion}\\
+\left(C_{t}-1\right)\cdot(1-\alpha)\cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{L_{_{TCA}}}\right)^{n} & = & 0,\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\size default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of tags, and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the slot durations constant defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}=\frac{t_{e}}{t_{c}}$
\end_inset

.
 Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) shows the exact relation between the proposed collision recovery, the
 time-aware optimum frame length 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{_{CTA}}$
\end_inset

 and the number of tags 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 This equation takes into consideration the collision recovery probability
 and the different slot durations.
 However, this solution depends on a recursive equation.
 For reaching an explicit equation, (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) can be expressed by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\frac{1}{\beta})+\alpha\cdot C_{t}\cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta n}\right)\label{eq:bita equation}\\

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\size default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\frac{L_{TCA}}{n}$
\end_inset

 As we are focusing on systems with many tags 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, again the following approximation can be used
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\underset{n\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\left(1-\frac{1}{\beta n}\right)^{n}=e^{-\frac{1}{\beta}},\label{eq:approx_1}

+(1-\alpha)\cdot\left(C_{t}-1\right)e^{-\frac{1}{\beta}} & = & 0.\nonumber

 Hence, we can develop a Taylor series for

\end_inset

 around one which leads to be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula

\size default
After substituting in (

\begin_inset Formula

\beta^{2}C_{t}-\beta C_{t}(1+\frac{\alpha}{n})-0.5\left(1-\alpha\right)\cdot\left(1-C_{t}\right)=0.\label{eq:quadratic equation}

\end_inset

As 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha}{n}\ll1,$

By solving (

Multiple Collision Recovery System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To simplify the analysis, previous sections considered systems with equal
 collision recovery probability coefficients regardless the number of collided
 tags per slot.
 For example, the probability to resolve two collided tags is equal to the
 probability to resolve three or four collided tags per slot.
 However, in practice, the probability of recovering one tag from two collided

 tags.
 Therefore, in this section, the collision recovery probability is considered

In this section, a new reading efficiency metric called multiple collision
 recovery coefficients reading efficiency

 is proposed.
 It includes a unique collision resolving coefficient for each number of
 collided tags.
 Hence, a novel closed form solution for the optimum FSA frame length is
 proposed, which maximizes the proposed efficiency metric.
 Then, these coefficients is calculated based on a simple RFID reader model
 to show how the proposed system could be applied on real-life applications.

, collisions in RFID systems occur only within the 
\begin_inset Formula $16$
\end_inset

 bits packet called 
\begin_inset Formula $RN16$
\end_inset

 If any single bit error occurs in this packet, the total packet must be
 considered lost.
 Therefore, the meaning of the collision recovery probability coefficients

\end_inset

 is the probability that the RFID reader can identify a complete 
\begin_inset Formula $RN16$
\end_inset

 packet from 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 collided tags.
 Therefore, the collision recovery coefficient can be expressed by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}=\left(1-PER_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $PER_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the Packet Error Rate for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 In this work, we measure the SNR for each slot, then we calculate the average

 slot, and at last, a normalized signal power is used, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left\{ x^{2}\right\} =1$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the equivalent channel coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 follow Rayleigh fading, which is a common assumption for dense RFID application
s

 The channel coefficients are independent on zero mean circularly symmetric
 complex Gaussian random variables with normalized energy

The most crucial performance metric in RFID systems is the average total

 It compares between the average total reading time of the proposed frame
 lengths and the conventional one which takes

 The theoretical lower limit is achieved when the system identifies a single

 Therefore, the minimum number of slots required to identify

 The main objective of these simulations is to evaluate the performance
 of the proposed frame lengths formulas without the effect of the proposed
 ML number of tags estimation algorithm.
 As discussed in chapter 4, the lower bound number of tags estimation neglects
 the collision recovery capability of the PHY layer and gives the minimum
 number of the remaining tags in the reading area.
 According to figure

\begin_inset Formula $\unit[16]{\%}$

 saving in the average total reading time compared to the conventional FSA.
 The Time and Constant Collision Recovery Aware frame length proposal saves
 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[10]{\%}$

 more than the Time Aware frame length, because of the new information about
 the collision recovery coefficient.
 In the time and constant collision recovery aware, the average collision

.
 In case of the time and multiple collision recovery frame length, the algorithm
 achieves

 shows the average reading time with the proposed collision recovery aware
 ML number of tags estimation.
 The main target is to evaluate the performance of the proposed frame lengths
 formulas using the proposed ML number of tags estimation algorithm.
 According to figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Summary_with_no_patent"

\end_inset

, the time aware frame length proposal gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[10]{\%}$
\end_inset

 saving in the average total reading time compared to the conventional FSA.
 The time and constant collision recovery aware frame length proposal results
 in  
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[18]{\%}$
\end_inset

 average saving in the reading time compared to the conventional DFSA.
 In case of the time and multiple collision recovery frame length, the proposed
 solution results in 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[22]{\%}$
\end_inset

 average saving in the reading time compared to the conventional DFSA.

\begin_layout Standard
According to figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Main_comp_no_patent"

\end_inset

, the percentage of saving in reading time with a simple number of tags
 estimation algorithm is more than the percentage of saving time using the
 proposed ML number of tags estimation.
 This is because the total identification time with simple number of tags
 estimation is more than that with the proposed ML number of tags estimation.
 Thus, the number of reading cycles and frame length adaptation with simple
 number of tags estimation is more than the number of reading cycles with
 the proposed number of tags estimation.
 However, the average reading time for DFSA using the proposed frame length
 formulas with the proposed ML estimation is less than the average reading
 time with simple number of tags estimation.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows a summary of the performance analysis for the proposed frame length
 formulas with simple number of tags estimation and with ML number of tags
 estimation.

According to the above results, there is still a gap of 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[10]{\%}$
\end_inset

 between the proposed systems and the theoretical limit of the EPCglobal
 C1 G2 standard 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "standard"

\end_inset

.
 The main reason of this is, that the allowed optimization was only in the
 reader side.
 To follow the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "standard"

\end_inset

, the tags could not be modified.
 Consequently, in the next chapter, backwards compatible improvement of
 the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard are proposed.
 The proposed system is compatible with the EPCglobal C1 G2 standard, i.e.,
 the proposed tags could be jointly operated with conventional tags and
 identified by conventional readers without affecting the performance.
 Additionally, conventional tags can also be operated together with the
 proposed tags and can be identified by the proposed reader.
