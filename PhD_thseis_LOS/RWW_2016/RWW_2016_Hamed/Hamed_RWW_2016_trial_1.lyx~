\begin_layout Abstract
In Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, when multiple tags reply
 at the same slot, collision occurs.
 The tags reply are with different data and also different rates.
 The rate tolerance between the tags reply reaches to +/-22% of the nominal
 value of the rate which plays a significant role for the stability and
 the efficiency of RFID systems.
 This variation in the tags reply rates inhibit to use the ML receiver which
 is very sensitive to the rate variation between collided replies.
 This paper focuses on decoding the collided tags with different rates in
 the RFID systems using Maximum Likelihood (ML) receiver.
 A new algorithm is proposed to make the ML receiver is insensitive the
 rate tolerance between the tags reply.
 The simulations show that the dual receive antennas ML receiver that is
 used to recover two collided tags over Rayleigh channel is not affected
 by the rate tolerance.
 The receiver performance is compared with the previous proposed dual antenna
 receivers, Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), Zero Forcing (ZF), and Ordered
 SUccessive Cancellation (OSUC).
 The proposed receiver outperforms the other types of receivers as it has
 the largest diversity gain.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an automatic identification system
 that uses wireless communications to identify objects.
 Nowadays, large amount of RFID tags are used in supply chain for product
 identification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Finkenzeller_book"

\end_inset

, or sensor networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rfid_sensor_network"

\end_inset

, where the cost and energy are critical.
 One of the biggest RFID challenges is the capability to resolve collisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the RFID tags are within the reading area of the reader are scheduled
 using Frame Slotted Aloha (FSA).
 As a result of that, only a single tag response can be decoded successfully,
 and in case of more than single tag reply at the same slot, the collision
 occurs, therefore the total slot will be discarded 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "collision_def"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, the diversities of transmitted signals from different
 collided tags, mainly on channel coefficient and data rates, may affect
 the stability and efficiency of RFID system severely.
 In UHF RFID systems, the data rate variations are much more crucial than
 in other communication systems and if they are not taken into consideration,
 it would be very difficult to make a correct decoding, leading to an inefficien
t communication 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Synch_with_timing_recovery"

\end_inset

.
 These data rate variations appear from two factors that can not be mitigated
 in practical systems.
 Firstly, due to low cost, RFID tags use a slow system clock for the digital
 base-band operation, resulting in a measurement error for the parameters
 that are transmitted by the reader to determine the tag data rate.
 In the EPCglobal Class-1 Gen-2 RFID protocol, this tag reply rate is called
 Backscatter Link Frequency (BLF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "standard"

\end_inset

.
 Secondly, the tag clock frequency is usually affected by manufacturing
 process variations, which also contribute to the BLF variations.
 Based on the standard, a maximum BLF tolerance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm22\%$
\end_inset

 is allowed with a BLF range from 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[40]{kHz}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[640]{kHz}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "standard"

\end_inset

.
 However, most of previous researches that focus on collision recovery for
 RFID system assume that the collided tags have the same BLF which is not
 valid assumption anymore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different groups paid attention on slots with colliding RFID tag replies.
 Angerer et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 proposed an algorithm for channel estimation for two colliding tags to
 be encoperated with single and multiple antennas techniques to separate
 the collided tags.
 However, they did not take the tolerance in the BLF into account in his
 simulation.
 Also he did not use the optimum receiver because of BLF tolerance.
 Kimionis et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Inventory_time_reduction"

\end_inset

 proposed a collision recovery technique to separate two and three collided
 tags based on the tag reply encoding scheme properties.
 The proposed algorithm will completely fail, if the tolerance of the BLF
 is taken into consideration.
 Kaitovic et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "smart_collision_recov"

\end_inset

 proposed a channel estimation technique that could be used to separate
 up to eight collided tags per slot.
 However, this technique is not compatible with the EPCglobal Class-1 Gen-2
 RFID protocol and also the rate tolerance is not taken into consideration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we present a collision recovery technique based on Maximum
 Likelihood (ML) receiver with taking into consideration the BLF tolerance.
 The ML decoding is very sensitive to the rate tolerance between the collided
 symbols, so the proposed algorithm is used to mitigate this sensitivity.
 The collision recovery technique is tested with two collided tags with
 different tolerance values as based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, there is no channel estimation technique compatible with the standard

 As the FM0 encoding offers the higher data rate, most of the readers use
 this encoding scheme and this paper focuses on it.

According to the standard, the nominal symbol duration value depends on
 the tag reply encoding technique.
 It is a multiple of the inverse of the BLF.
 In case of FM0 encoding, the symbol period is related to the BLF by:

 shows the basic communication between two tags and a RFID reader, equipped
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 receive antennas.
 In passive RFID systems the communication is half-duplex.
 The reader provides the RFID tags with energy in form of a continuous carrier
 transmission.
 During this energy signal the reader sends some specific commands to the
 tags to tell them about the rate they should reply with, the modulation
 technique that should be used, and the number of available slots.
 Then the tags use the reader information to backscatter their IDs.
 Because of this type of communication link, the channel that each tag reply
 faces is a backscatter channel.
 The backscatter channel is a forward channel (reader to tag) and a backward
 channel (tag to reader) multiplied to each other.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the authors proposed a two-way Rician channel model for RFID scenarios
 based on carried out channel measurements.
 They also showed that since Rician factor strongly depends on the environment,
 a better fit to the measurement data was achieved by applying a double
 Rayleigh distribution.

ML Decoding for Non-Synchronized Collided Tags
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the receiver is to obtain an estimate of the modulation
 signal of tags, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, from the given received data in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with noise variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}^{2}$
\end_inset

, through channel 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H}$
\end_inset

.
 There are a wide variety of techniques for doing this but as stated in
 the introduction this work will only be concerned with the maximum likelihood
 (ML) detector.
 The ML detector has the desirable property that, it minimizes the probability
 of error, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{e}\triangleq P(\mathbf{x}\neq\hat{\mathbf{x}})\label{eq:prob. of error def}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimizing the probability of error is equivalent to maximizing the probability
 of correctly estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{x}=\hat{\mathbf{x}}\mid y,\mathbf{H})$
\end_inset

.
 To maximize the probability of correctly estimating we have to maximize
 the probability density function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{H}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ML detector is the optimum receiver from performance point of view.
 However, the performance of the receiver is severely affected with the
 non-synchronization of the received symbol which is the case in the RFID
 system as shown figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ML decoding for non-synchronized tags"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper we propose an algorithm that makes the ML receiver does not
 care about the synchronization between received symbols.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ML decoding for non-synchronized tags"

\end_inset

 shows two collided with two different symbol duration, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}<T_{2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}=\frac{1}{BLF_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 The problem of non-synchronized tags is that the symbol of the tag that
 has a lower symbol duration 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 overlaps two symbols of the tag that has an higher symbol duration 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 For example the second symbol of Tag1 overlaps the second symbol of Tag2
 in an interval equals to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}-2\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 of the first symbol, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=T_{2}-T_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The overlap between symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of Tag1 and symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of Tag2 equals to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}-i\text{\cdot\delta}$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to the overlap between symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of Tag1 and symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 of Tag2 equals to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(i-1\right)\text{\cdot\delta}$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the this formulation of the rate tolerance problem, we designed
 an algorithm to solve the problem.
 First, we have assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $BLF_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $BLF_{2}$
\end_inset

 are accurately estimated using MUSIC algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "raey"

\end_inset

.
 Then the generated vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 will contain two elements as we are taking two collided tags as an example.
 Assume we are talking about decoding symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of Tag1; the first element in vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 will be a symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 of Tag1 with symbol length 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

, and the second element is 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}-i\delta$
\end_inset

 of symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(i-1\right)\cdot\delta$
\end_inset

 of symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

.
 This process would be repeated till the end of Tag1 symbols, then the remaining
 part of Tag2 symbols can be decoded separately as in this part there is
 no collision.
 The decision on Tag1 symbols can be taken directly, but the symbols of
 Tag2 should be reconstructed first and then decoded using regular correlator
 receiver.

For the sake of a simple comparison, we assume that the equivalent channel

 follows a Rayleigh fading.
 The single Rayleigh channel coefficient are independent zero mean circularly
 symmetric complex Gaussian random variables with normalized energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E\{\left|h_{i}\right|^{2}\}=1$
\end_inset

, which indicates the two collided tags have the same average path loss.

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $22\%$
\end_inset

 and how the performance is not affected by the value of tolerance.
 In the simulation, both tags of uncoded random data are decoded depending
 on the average received SNR 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\frac{1}{N_{R}}\sum_{j}\bar{\gamma}_{j}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}=\left|h_{ij}\right|^{2}x_{i}^{2}/\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the instantaneous SNR at antenna

 for tag 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}_{j}=E\{\gamma_{j}\}$

 Additionally to disturbance by noise, each stream is interfered by the
 second tag responding in the same slot, with the same average power.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, a novel algorithm for decoding two collided and non-synchronized
 tags using ML decoding.
 The algorithm mainly depends on generating different basis functions instead
 of regular basis function that are used when the tags are synchronized.
 The receiver is tested in a Rayleigh fading channel with AWGN to see the
 effect of tolerance on it.
 The simulation shows that the tolerance of BLF has no effect on the receiver
 performance.
 The receiver is compared with the ZF, MMSE, and OSUC receivers that were
 proposed by
