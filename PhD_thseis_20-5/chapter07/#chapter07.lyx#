Conclusion And Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays, there has been a great interest in RFID due to the vast array
 of applications used in this field.
 RFID systems provide low cost and low power object identification and tracking
 mechanisms, being the key requirement for anticipated ultra dense applications,
 e.g., Logistics.
 In such applications, dense number of tags are expected and

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advanced RFID readers proposed in this thesis improve performances and
 shorten the read out time.
 They incorporate different PHY layer parameters in order to efficiently
 optimize the MAC anti-collision protocols.
 They merged the collision recovery coefficients and the differences in
 slot durations.
 Thus, in order to benefit from the collision recovery expertise, changes
 in the number of tags estimations should be applied.
 Besides, the higher collision recovery capability of the system, the shorter
 optimum frame length is recommended.
 According to the differences in slot duration results, the smaller the
 duration of the empty slot compared to that of the collided slot, the longer
 optimum FSA frame length is required.
 Additionally, the evaluation of the complete read out process is performed
 and the obtained results prove that the proposed advanced RFID readers
 significantly decrease the identification time.
 Due to the simple tags implementation in EPCglobal C1 G2, improvements
 in the standards would be recommended to approach the theoretical limit
 of the reading time.

Open Issues and Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the effort invested in this dissertation, there are still some remining
 issues left that require further investigations.
 To mention but some examples, the influence of the initial frame length
 of the proposed system is neglected.
 The influence of the initial frame length should be analyzed.
 In addition, the MAC layer knowledge of the current SNR should send a feedback
 signal to the PHY layer.
 In this signal, the MAC layer decide to start resolving the current collided
 slot either to a successful or unsuccessful slot, depending on the current
 value of the SNR.
 Thereby, if the current SNR value is below a certain threshold, it might
 be better to leave this slot to a normal collided slot.
 On the other hand, when the current value of the SNR is above this threshold,
 it would be better to resolve this collided slot to a successful slot.
 Last but not least, practical assessment of the proposed work through measureme
nts would be beneficial for a more comprehensive evaluation.
